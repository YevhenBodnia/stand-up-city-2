            This year we are all facing heavy times and it’s even harder to get through with the comedy clubs
            closed! Where do we turn to for comic relief and how the heck do comics get a paid gig?
            <br>
            <br>
            Stand Up City is the place where people can turn to for good laughs, great stories, and the chance to
            discover new comics without paying general admission. On the same time it is the place where comics can
            do what they do best while getting paid and a chance at winning a couple grand.

            <p>
                Joe Blum is the host of Stand Up City! …well mainly because he needs a hobby and you can only masterbate
                so much. Besides the fondling, Joe has spent the last decade entertaining and making people laugh as a
                comedian and radio personality on various FM stations across the country including NYC, Seattle,
                Portland and other towns you probably wouldn’t ever want to visit.
                <br><br>
                Although he hasn’t grown much both psychically or mentally since then, Joe is also the host of The Z100
                Late Show under the name Brady (long story) on, you guessed it...Z100. On top of that, he hosts a
                national radio show performing his comedy airing on various radio stations across the country...once
                again, mostly in towns you would never want to live in. No one wanted to live there, but this guys,
                gals, and non-binary pals, this is the city everyone wants to be apart of… Stand Up City with Joe Blum.
